# jCloudScale Lambda

This is a research project by the Software Evolution and Architecture Lab at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Zurich.

The aim of this project is to foster a more seamless development of Java-based Lambda applications. The general idea will follow the development model pioneered by JCloudScale, wherein cloud applications are built as local Java applications and cloud services are "injected" at application startup via bytecode transformation.

This repository contains a [configuration guideline](docs/Configuration.md), which explain how to setup your first application. Next an [overview of the annotations and exceptions from the framework](docs/Annotations_and_Exceptions.md) and [restrictions](docs/Restrictions.md) are summarized. Last, some [useful links](docs/Useful_Link.md) are listed, which maybe help to develop an application with jCloudScale Lambda.
